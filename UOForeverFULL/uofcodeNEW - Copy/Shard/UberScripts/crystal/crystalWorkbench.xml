			<p>The crystal in this workbench has mystical properties that enable you to imbue armor with Gargish runes. If placed in the correct order (left to right) and with the correct combination, the armor will be endowed with protective properties against a particular order of beings.</p>
			<p>You do sense, however, that using the wrong runic combination could be deadly and could ruin the armor! Therefore, be sure that you have placed them in the right order!</p>
			<p>Press the Imbue button below in order to imbue with the runes that you have on the workbench.</p>
			<p>This must be locked down in your house to use it.</p>

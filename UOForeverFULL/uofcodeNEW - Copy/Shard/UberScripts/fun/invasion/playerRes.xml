			<p>For the duration of this event, you have the option to pay 4,000 gold to resurrect with basic supplies.</p>
			
			<p>If you accept, in 30 seconds you will be transported somewhere in Britain (at random) with: 40 of each reagent, 80 bandages, 4 trapped pouches, and an exceptional weapon (if you have a weapon skill), 2 greater cure, greater heal, and total refresh potions, and 2 poison potions if you have poisoning.</p>
			
			<p>The cost of these items is about 1700 gold if purchased from vendors, so while you are paying a bit more than that, this will enable you to get back into the action faster!</p>
			
			<p>If you resurrect during the 30 second wait time, you will NOT be moved, but you will get all the stuff.</p>
